        To understand what happened for the bug, we need `DEBUG` logs that show clearly the issue or what lead to it.
        By adding the `log_level` configuration parameter to `DEBUG` in your apps.yaml file, you will be able to grab
        that data, and provide it under here. Your apps.yaml configuration for `qolsysgw` should then look
        like something like this:

        ```yaml
        qolsys_panel:
          module: gateway
          class: QolsysGateway
          log_level: DEBUG
          ...
        ```

        You then will be able to find the `qolsysgw` logs by looking at the AppDaemon logs.

        If relevant to your bug, please also add logs of Home Assistant.
